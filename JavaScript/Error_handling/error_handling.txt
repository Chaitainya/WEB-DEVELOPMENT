Whenever an error occurs, the execution of the code stops
i.e, the program terminates abnormally without
executing the next lines of code.

Q. What is error handling is?
A. Error handling is the process of skipping the line of code,
   which raises an error and continue executing the next lines of code.
   It is our responsbility to see if they're any errors occur, then that particular error or more should be skipped,
   then the remaining lines of the code must be executed.

Q. How do we handle the errors?
A. Concept of trycatch mechanism.

We achieve error handling using try and catch blocks

try{
    //code
}

whichever the code that could raise an error should be kept in try block.

catch block will handle the error and helps in continuation of execution of other lines of code.

catch(error){
    write code for displaying error message
}
