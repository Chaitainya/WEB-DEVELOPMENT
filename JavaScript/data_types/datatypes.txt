Datatypes: 

A datatype is used by the memory manager to provide the memory to some data based on its type.

In JS, we cannot specify the datatype of a variable. Instead, based on the value stored in a variable, the datatype is confirmed.

in JS, we have 5 Datatypes,

1. String
2. Number
3. Object
4. Arrays &
5. Boolean

Number: Any number, that could be decimal / Non-Decimal comes under number datatypes.
