1. Local Variable: A variable which is created inside a function is known as local variables.
2. global Variable A variable which is created outside of the function is known as global variables.



Syntax:

  var var_name = value;

  var age = 20;

  var -> keyword
  age -> variable name
  20 -> data
  


Data -> Numbers, String, Boolean, Arrays & Objects

Global variable values can be changed at any location in the application.
