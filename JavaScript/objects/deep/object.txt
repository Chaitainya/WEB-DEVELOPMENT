Object:

In JS, we create an object to store the information of a specific entity.

syntax:

var obj = {
    key: value
}

keys should be strings and should be unique.

values can be of any type and need not to be unique.


If we want to share data from client to server or vice versa, we wrap the data in objects and share.


--> We can create an object in multiple ways,

1, {key: value}

2, using function Constructor and

3, create

create: If we want to create a new object from existing object, then use create.
