Scopes:

In JS, there are 2 types of scopes.

1. Local Scope: Local variables and local functions come under local scopes.
2. Global Scope: Global variables and just functions will come under global scopes.

note:

"""It is advised to use local scope more than global scope."""






Events:

Any action is considered to be an event.


eg: clicking on a button, selecting an option from a drop down list,
    entering data into a text field, moving the cursor on to the image...


whenever an event occurs, then there should be an event handler.

Event Handlers:

Event handlers are nothing but the function that handles the event.

We've different types of events provided by JS,
onClick, onChange, ondblclick, onmouseover, onmouseout, onprint, ondrag..
