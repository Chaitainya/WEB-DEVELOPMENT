// In the real world app there are situations that we don't want the value of the varible to change,
// because otherwise its gonna create a all kinds of bugs in our application.
// In those situations instead of variable we use constant.

// The value of the variable we can change but the value of the constant we cannot change.

// eg:
const interestRate = 0.3;
interestRate = 1;
console.log(interestRate);

// If you don't need to reassign constant is the defalut choice
// If you want to reassign use var.
