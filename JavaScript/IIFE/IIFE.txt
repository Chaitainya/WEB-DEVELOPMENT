IIFE:

" Immediately Invoked Function Expression "

--> If the function gets invoked by itself, immediately right after its declaration,
    then it is called as "IIFE".

syntax:

    function()
    {

    }() --> ' IIFE '

" () --> IIFE "

Where do we use?

whenever we want to create a function that should automatically called only once
through out application, then we use IIFE.

1. To load configuration information
2. To load data form different data sources(database, files etc)
