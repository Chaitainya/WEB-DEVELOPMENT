while:

syntax:

  while(test-condition){

      //code
  }

  if the test test condition is true, it'll execute the code.
  if not it will iterate till the condition is true.

  the best time to use while is, when we have a list of items

  if we don't know the no.of iterations we will with "while".
  if we know, we'll go with "for"

  whatever we can do with while, we can also do with for.
  whatever we can do with for, we can also do with while.
