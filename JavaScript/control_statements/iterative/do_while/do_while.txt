do-while:

syntax:

do{

    //code

}while(test-condition)


difference between while and do-while is,

In do-while, the test condition will be checked only after the execution of do block,
if the condition is true, then control goes back to do block again.

In while, the test condition will be checked first, then based on the result,
the control may go to the block or it skips the block.
