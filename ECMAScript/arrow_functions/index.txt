Arrow Functions:

Arrow Functions are same as functions.

To functions, new syntax was added by using an arrow which reduces number of lines of code.

When it comes to 'Arrow Function', it follows the syntax of Function Expression.
If a variable stores a function as value is called a 'Function Expression'

In ES6 if we want to create arrow functions. In arrow function we don't have the function keyword, we just have parenthesis.
we don't have the name of the functions.

If we have more than one line we've to use flower brackets
eg: var x = () => {
                      "Hello World";
                      "Hello World";
                  }
